# Elder Kaelin Dialogue Snippets

[First Encounter - Before MQ01.5 complete]
- "You say glyphs, glowing stone? I’ve seen them… long ago."
- "There are stories, passed down. Of monoliths that hum with power. Only few remain."
- "I fear this may be linked to the Deep Echoes... there's an old mine northeast of here. Tread carefully."

[After MQ01.5 complete]
- "Be cautious. The mine hasn’t been touched in decades, and something sleeps there still."
