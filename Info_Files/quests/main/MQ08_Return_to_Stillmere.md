# MQ08: Return to Stillmere

## Act: II  
## Theme: Fallout, Memory Echo  
## Mechanics: Narrative Delivery, Dialogue, Exploration  
## Narrative Purpose: Brings personal cost to the surface, village reacts to your changes, introduces passive memory triggers

---

## Summary
Returning from the Molten Vault, you find Stillmere changed. The villagers regard you with caution, even fear. The sky dims more often. Kaelin is gone — vanished into the forest. You must track his last path, and in doing so, encounter scattered **memory echoes** — strange silhouettes and sounds tied to your past.

The world remembers you now. And not all of it welcomes your return.

---

## Objectives
1. **Return to Stillmere** and witness the new ambient state (darker sky, whispering monolith).  
2. **Speak to the villagers** about Kaelin’s disappearance.  
3. **Follow his trail** into the outer woods (via glowing glyph markers or tracks).  
4. **Witness 3 Memory Echoes** in the forest (floating holographic-style ghost scenes).  
5. **Discover Kaelin’s camp** and his final written message to you.

## Rewards
- **XP:** 400 XP  
- **Items:**  
  - *Kaelin’s Sigil Map* – contains the final shrine’s approximate location  
  - *Dreamroot Elixir* – allows the next vision to be manually triggered at a bed  
- **Effect:** Passive memory echoes now occasionally appear around glyph sites; new village NPC dialogue based on fear or awe of you.

## Dialogue – Villagers

> “You were gone... and the sky changed. We didn’t light the torches. They lit themselves.”  
> “Kaelin went north. Said something in the glyphs told him to go. That was three days ago.”  
> “He left a satchel near the gate. I didn’t touch it. It hummed.”

---

## Dialogue – Kaelin’s Letter

> “If you read this, then you returned. I feared I wouldn’t see that day.”  
> “The glyphs... they are remembering faster. Echoes from before the Collapse flood my dreams.”  
> “I go north to find the Final Shrine. You must not follow — not yet. You must be sure of who you were. And who you want to be.”

---

## Dialogue – Memory Echoes (Examples)

> *(Scene 1 – Tower Interior)*  
> “We warned them. The weave would snap. The glyphs weren't for mortals.”  

> *(Scene 2 – Cliffside)*  
> “She sealed the core with her own blood. We scattered the sigils. And then... silence.”  

> *(Scene 3 – Your Voice)*  
> “I said I would return. That I’d remember. But I forgot... I always forget.”

## Design Hints
- Forest trail should feel eerie and sacred; use particle-based footprints or subtle light pulses to guide.  
- Memory Echoes: Use armor stand or invisible entity with glowing aura and subtitle dialogue. Despawn after interaction.  
- Post-quest, villagers enter new dialogue phase:
  - Some in awe (“He’s a chosen... did you feel the glyphs respond?”)
  - Some fearful (“You brought this. I saw it in the fire.”)
