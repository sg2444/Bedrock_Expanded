# FQ03: Shatter & Rebuild

## Summary:
The central monolith begins to crack. You must enter its core and decide whether to repair the fracture, redirect the energy, or break it completely to start anew.

## Objectives:
1. Enter the **Monolith Heart** via dream trigger.  
2. Solve a memory sequencing puzzle (requires recalling MQ order).  
3. Make one of 3 choices:
   - Repair (Seal-leaning)  
   - Redirect (Balanced)  
   - Shatter (Freedom)

## Rewards:
- 850 XP  
- *True Sigil Fragment*  
- Access to postgame shrine reconstructions

## End Result:
- Alters monolith behavior globally:  
   - Repair: glow returns to pale blue  
   - Redirect: world gains dynamic glyph events  
   - Shatter: shrine fragments spawn creatures and lore
