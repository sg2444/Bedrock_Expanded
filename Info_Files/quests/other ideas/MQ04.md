# MQ04: The Hidden Stronghold

## Summary

Armed with blaze powder from the Nether, the final key to locating the ancient Dragon is within reach. The Village Scholar explains that combining blaze powder with Ender pearls will create **Eyes of Ender**, mystical orbs that can reveal the hidden **stronghold** where the End Portal lies. Your task is to hunt the elusive Endermen for their pearls, craft the Eyes, and follow their guidance to the stronghold’s entrance. Once discovered, activate the portal deep within and prepare for the ultimate battle. The fate of the realm hinges on you uncovering the path to the End.

## Objectives

1. **Obtain Ender Pearls:** Hunt Endermen in the wild (or trade with villagers if possible) to collect at least **12 Ender Pearls**.
2. **Craft Eyes of Ender:** Use the Ender Pearls and blaze powder to craft **Eyes of Ender**.
3. **Locate the Stronghold:** Throw an Eye of Ender and follow its trajectory to triangulate the location of the hidden stronghold. Travel until the Eyes lead you to the stronghold’s vicinity.
4. **Explore the Stronghold:** Delve into the underground stronghold corridors. Navigate its labyrinthine halls and locate the **End Portal** room.
5. **Activate the End Portal:** Place Eyes of Ender into the portal frame slots (12/12) to activate the **portal to the End**. Do **not enter** yet – ensure you are fully prepared for the battle beyond.

## Quest Giver Dialogue (Village Scholar)

- "At last, we have what we need to find the lair of the beast. Now, **Ender pearls** must be gathered – those can be won from the fallen bodies of Endermen. Stalk the night or deep caves to find them, or perhaps seek a trade. One way or another, we’ll need a dozen."
- "Combine the pearls with the blaze powder you obtained to **craft Eyes of Ender**. These Eyes will guide you to the **stronghold**, an underground fortress where the ancient portal resides. It could be leagues away, hidden beneath field or ocean – the journey will be long."
- "Once the Eyes lead you to throw one that hovers above a spot or dives into the earth, you’ve found the stronghold. **Dig down carefully** and explore its halls. When you find the **End Portal**, place the Eyes of Ender into its frame to activate it... and then steel yourself. Return to us once the portal is open; we will gather our courage and see you off for the final confrontation."
