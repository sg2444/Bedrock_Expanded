# MQ07: Whispers of Earthfire

## Act: II  
## Theme: Descent, Lost Knowledge  
## Mechanics: Lava Biome Exploration, Timed Puzzle, Combat  
## Narrative Purpose: Deepens mystery of glyphs, introduces Earthfire as volatile power source

---

## Summary
With the Fragmented repelled (for now), Kaelin reveals the next shrine lies far beneath the surface — in the **Molten Vault**, a vast cavern where Earthfire once surged. Long sealed, this volcanic site powered the first glyph cores and now lies dormant... or nearly so.

The shrine within is heavily decayed. Its systems require you to reroute geothermal vents to reactivate its core. But when awakened, it reveals something shocking — the glyphs are not of this world.

---

## Objectives
1. **Locate the Molten Vault** deep below the mountain biome.  
2. **Reroute Earthfire conduits** by solving a timed pressure plate / redstone switch puzzle.  
3. **Survive the Lava Surges** (scripted area that floods intermittently).  
4. **Activate the third shrine core** and defeat its guardian.  
5. **Retrieve the third Shrine Sigil Fragment (3/4)** and a strange alien shard.

## Dialogue – Kaelin (Before the Vault)

> “The Earthfire once flowed like blood through the world’s veins. It fed the glyphs... and nearly destroyed the basin that held it.”  
> “The Ancients drew too deeply. Their machines shattered, and the power burned through the crust.”  
> “You must descend — through stone, heat, and memory. The shrine there may be broken, but the truth still sleeps beneath its ashes.”

## Dialogue – Shrine Guardian (After Core Reboot)

> *“The flame is not yours.”*  
> *“You light the old fire... but you do not burn as we did.”*  
> *“Why return, flamebearer? The ash remembers. And it fears.”*

---

## Dialogue – Echo Voice (Post-Shrine)

> *(“You burn. But not as they did. You are not theirs.”)*  
> *(“This world was borrowed. We came before. We sealed the doors... because we saw the future.”)*  
> *(“There is one shrine left. And then... the Eye will open.”)*

## Design Hints
- Vault environment: Use blackstone, basalt, magma blocks, chains, and nether-themed décor.  
- Earthfire conduit puzzle: A timed puzzle using levers/plates that must be activated in order, resetting on failure (cue lava surge).  
- Guardian: A fire-wreathed construct that uses fireball projectiles and knockback attacks.  
- Alien reveal: Use subtle visual elements (non-vanilla symbols, geometric glyphs, otherworldly music) to tease the extra-dimensional nature of the glyph system.
