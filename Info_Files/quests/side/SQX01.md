# SQX01: The Echoed Bell

## Type: Mystery / Lore  
## Region: Abandoned Chapel, near forest monolith  
## Recommended Level: Any  
## Prerequisite: MQ04 complete (monolith communion unlocked)

---

## Summary
You discover an old chapel deep in the forest. A cracked bell hangs above the altar. If rung during certain phases of the moon, the bell causes **memory ripples** — revealing fragments of events long past. Some villagers whisper that the bell tolls when a sealer’s memory awakens.

---

## Objectives
1. Find the **Abandoned Chapel** east of Stillmere.  
2. Ring the bell at midnight during a half-moon (can be fast-forwarded using /time or Dreamroot).  
3. Witness three memory fragments:  
   - A vision of the Collapse  
   - A lost sealer’s confession  
   - A warning from a future echo  
4. Record the glyph pattern left behind and bring it to Elder Kaelin or Seeker Avenya (if alive).

## Rewards
- 450 XP  
- *Inscribed Bell Fragment* (used in future dream gear)  
- Unlocks random glyph visions near other ruined churches

## Dialogue

### Memory Fragment 1 (Collapse)
> *(“They said we had days. We had hours.”)*  
> *(“The glyphs... they *took* our choices.”)*

### Memory Fragment 2 (Sealer’s Confession)
> *(“I sealed her. My sister. She begged me. I failed.”)*  
> *(“I hear her every time the bell tolls.”)*

### Memory Fragment 3 (Future Echo)
> *(“He returns. The one who rang the bell. He *knows* what we’ve forgotten.”)*  
> *(“The bell must not ring again. Unless… unless he is ready.”)*

## Notes
- After completion, players occasionally hear faint bell tolls at midnight near shrines.  
- Dreamwalker path reacts strongly to the bell and may unlock an alternate dream route if player brings fragment to the Echo Plane.
