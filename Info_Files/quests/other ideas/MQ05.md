# MQ05: The End Beckons

## Summary

The portal to the End is open, revealing a void beyond imagination. Beyond its shimmering field lies the **End**, a barren alien realm where the legendary Ender Dragon awaits. This is the climactic battle that all your efforts have led to. Stepping through the portal will transport you to the End’s central island, where you must fight the Ender Dragon to save your world. Use all you’ve learned: destroy the crystals that empower the beast, evade its furious attacks, and strike true. The fate of the village – and perhaps all of Minecraftia – hinges on your victory in the End.

## Objectives

1. **Enter the End:** When you are fully prepared, **step through the End Portal** to the dragon’s realm.
2. **Destroy the End Crystals:** Find and destroy the **End Crystals** atop the obsidian pillars (these crystals heal the dragon, so you must remove its source of regeneration).
3. **Defeat the Ender Dragon:** Confront the mighty Ender Dragon and **slay the beast** once and for all.
4. **Survive the Ordeal:** Endure the battle’s aftermath and ensure you can return safely through the exit portal that appears upon the dragon’s defeat.

## Recommended XP

- **Experience Reward:** ~1000 XP (for vanquishing the penultimate threat, on top of the dragon’s own dropped XP)

## Rewards

- **Dragon Egg (trophy)** – The Dragon’s Egg, a unique trophy symbolizing your triumph over the Ender Dragon.
- **[Huge Experience Gain]** – (The dragon’s defeat showers you in experience, greatly boosting your levels.)

_(No other item rewards – the glory of victory and the path to the End Cities beyond are reward enough at this stage.)_

## Quest Giver Dialogue (Village Elder)

- "This is it. Beyond that portal lies the End and the beast that has haunted our nightmares. **The Ender Dragon** waits on the other side, but you will not face it alone in spirit – the hopes of our people go with you."
- "Remember: the dragon draws power from **strange crystals atop the obsidian towers**. You must destroy those crystals to strip away its healing, or your battle will be in vain. Use your bow, your wits – whatever it takes."
- "May the Ancients watch over you, hero. Your **final challenge awaits**. Return to us victorious, or not at all. For the village! For the dawn!"
