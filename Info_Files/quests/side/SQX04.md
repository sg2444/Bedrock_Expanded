## Summary
You find a **silent boy** sitting at the base of an inactive shrine. He stares blankly at the sky, unmoving. Locals say he hasn’t spoken since the glyphs flickered weeks ago. Avenya suspects he is a **dream-sensitive**, overwhelmed and trapped in his own unending vision. You must piece together his dreamscape and give him an exit.

## Objectives
1. Speak to Avenya (or shrine whisperer if she's gone).  
2. Activate the shrine with *Dreamroot Elixir* during dusk.  
3. Solve the Dreamwalker Puzzle:  
   - Reconstruct 3 fragments of the boy’s dream (shattered glyphs)  
   - Correct sequence reveals his memory: light, loss, voice  
4. Choose how to wake him:  
   - Speak his name  
   - Offer a memory  
   - Let him sleep peacefully
