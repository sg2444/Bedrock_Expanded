# SQ: Dreamwalker Path – The Memory Unbound

## Skill Path: Mystic / Vision-Based  
## Alignment: Enhanced if Echo is Freed or Balanced (unavailable if Sealed)

---

## Overview
Unlocked after the player communes at least 3 times with monoliths (e.g. MQ04, MQ06, MQ08), or drinks the **Dreamroot Elixir** given in MQ08. The Dreamwalker path allows you to explore alternate timelines, hidden truths, and visions that influence real-world outcomes.

Dreams are no longer just memory—they are gateways.

---

## Quest 1: *Dreamroot Baptism*

### Summary
A mystic named **Avenya** appears in Stillmere after MQ08. She claims you have “one foot in shadow” and offers to guide you into your first true vision. But first, you must earn the Dream’s trust.

### Objectives
1. Collect **Nightbloom Flowers** from a monolith-lit glade (only visible during midnight).  
2. Brew and drink the **Dreamroot Elixir**.  
3. Enter a scripted **vision maze** (simple dreamworld realm).  
4. Reach the **Memory Pool** and leave a drop of your own blood (consume 1 heart).  
5. Exit with your dreammark.

### Rewards
- 350 XP  
- *Dreammark* (status effect or cosmetic aura)  
- Unlocks ability to trigger dream sequences manually via shrine rest  

---

## Quest 2: *The Other Thread*

### Summary
Avenya believes the dreams are not just echoes — they are **threads** you can tug on. She challenges you to revisit a major decision (MQ05 shrine or MQ06 village attack) in a dream and attempt to alter its memory.

### Objectives
1. Choose a memory thread to revisit:  
   - *Sanctum Conflict* (alter shrine battle)  
   - *Kaelin’s Warning* (prevent journal from falling into wrong hands)  
2. Navigate a symbolic reconstruction of the event (floating dreamscape, voiced echoes).  
3. Solve a memory-based riddle (e.g., match Kaelin’s lines in correct order).  
4. Witness an **alternate outcome** (doesn’t change history but alters tone/dialogue).

### Rewards
- 500 XP  
- *Fragmented Memory Scroll*  
- Unlocks branching dream events and alters final MQ12 cutscene line  

---

## Quest 3: *Chronoseal*

### Summary
Avenya asks you to attempt something no mortal has done: **witness the Collapse in real time.** The dream is unstable, dangerous, and may leave a mark. But within it lies the truth of the Echo’s creation.

### Objectives
1. Sleep at the Monolith during a full moon (trigger dream transition).  
2. Enter the **Chrono-Echo**, a crumbling memory of the world just before the Collapse.  
3. Follow 3 *Sealers* across the vision as they debate sealing or freeing the Echo.  
4. Avoid being detected by **Echo Fragments** (shards of living memory).  
5. Escape the dream before time collapses entirely (timed segment).

### Rewards
- 800 XP  
- *Sealer’s Eye* (trinket or cosmetic glyph)  
- Unlocks knowledge of “True Name” of the Echo  
- Can be used in postgame monolith to open hidden chamber

---

## Optional Outcomes & Effects
- Dreamwalker can **see alternate versions** of familiar NPCs (used in ambient flavor)  
- Unlocks rare memory crafting materials only usable by dream-marked players  
- Postgame: dreamwalkers may **intervene in new prophecies** or receive messages from “beyond the seal”  
- Dream dialogue varies based on MQ11 and MQ12 outcome

---

## Notes
- Exclusive late-game path with narrative impact  
- Does not grant combat power but unlocks the deepest lore and cutscene modifiers  
- Can be combined with Echo Cult alignment for further branching dreams
