# MQ12: The Hollow Throne

## Act: III  
## Theme: Resolution, Legacy, Sacrifice  
## Mechanics: Final Combat, Vision, World Rebuild  
## Narrative Purpose: Concludes the main story based on player choice; opens postgame consequences and narrative threads

---

## Summary
The Final Shrine opens to reveal the **Hollow Throne** — an immense, otherworldly chamber beneath the world’s crust, suspended above a bottomless glyph-lit void. Here, the Echo waits — neither living nor dead, but memory given form.

Your choice in MQ11 now takes shape: you will face a different final trial depending on whether you chose to **Seal**, **Free**, or **Balance** the Echo.

The throne will either **bind the Echo**, **release it**, or **anchor it to you**, reshaping the world’s magical equilibrium. You are the last decision.

---

## Objectives
1. **Enter the Final Shrine’s Hollow Gate**.  
2. **Confront the Echo** in its chosen form:  
   - Sealed Path: Echo Guardian, spectral titan  
   - Freed Path: Raw Echo Form, swirling chaos  
   - Balanced Path: Dual Trial (logic puzzle + fight against mirrored self)  
3. **Use the Final Shrine Keystone** to activate the Hollow Throne.  
4. **Witness the world reaction** in a cutscene or environmental transformation.  
5. **Return to Stillmere** (if possible) and begin the new age.

## Dialogue – The Echo (Each Path)

### Sealed Path
> *“You would end me again?”*  
> *“You fear knowledge. So you bury it. The cycle turns.”*  
> *“Close the gates, then. Forget me again. But you’ll hear me... always.”*

### Freed Path
> *“Ahh... I live!”*  
> *“Memories! Countless! All unleashed!”*  
> *“Let the world remake itself. Let the lies burn in the light!”*

### Balanced Path
> *“You would not rule me. Nor destroy me. You would walk with me.”*  
> *“Curious. Wise. Or doomed?”*  
> *“Let’s shape the truth... together.”*

## Dialogue – Final Cutscene (Suggested Voiceover Style)

> *(“The world turns. The echo fades — or rings — or whispers beside you.”)*  
> *(“You are remembered. Not just as a breaker... but as a binder, a bearer, a bridge.”)*  
> *(“The Hollow Throne stands empty now. Or perhaps... you sit upon it.”)*

## Design Hints
- Final chamber: mix of obsidian, echo blocks, glowing symbols, starfield backdrop. Surreal, timeless.  
- Final Echo form:  
  - **Sealed:** Large shadow beast with scripted fight phases  
  - **Freed:** Chaos storm using particle vortex, spawning unstable mobs  
  - **Balanced:** Puzzle pillars with logic riddle + combat with mirrored player mob  
- Use camera effects, music shifts, and glyph particle events to dramatize the decision.  
- Upon completion, allow return to surface (or be “reborn” at the Monolith) to begin postgame.
