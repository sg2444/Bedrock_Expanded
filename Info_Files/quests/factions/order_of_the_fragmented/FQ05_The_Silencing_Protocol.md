# FQ05: The Silencing Protocol

## Summary:
A previously unknown **monolith transmitter** is detected. The Order wants it destroyed â€” but it's hidden in the Echo Plane. They request you infiltrate it under the guise of inspection.

## Objectives:
1. Enter the **Resonant Pillar** in the Echo Plane.  
2. Investigate the transmitter and interact with its dream logs.  
3. Decide whether to:  
   - Destroy the monolith and silence the message  
   - Alter the frequency to filter non-corruptive signals

## Rewards:
- 800 XP  
- *Severance Blade* (only damages glyph-based mobs)  
- Echo Plane access expands to 1 new shard island

## Branch Outcome:
- Silencing weakens Echo cult presence.  
- Filtering creates tension with Order, improves lore visibility.
