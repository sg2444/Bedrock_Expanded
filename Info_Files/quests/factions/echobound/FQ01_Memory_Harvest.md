# FQ01: Memory Harvest

## Summary:
An old monolith grove has awakened and echoes with unbound memory. The Echobound ask you to collect ambient memory droplets before they fade — and absorb one to “open your core.”

## Objectives:
1. Travel to **Grove of Words** (biome warped by resonance).  
2. Collect 5 memory wisps (floating particles avoid light).  
3. Absorb 1 memory to unlock a hidden cutscene.  
4. Deliver the rest to an Echobound Ritualist.

## Rewards:
- 500 XP  
- *Resonant Eye* cosmetic  
- Access to Echo Plane via dream-summon

## Effects:
- Unlocks memory “flash” when near unmarked glyphs.
