# FQ04: The Living Word

## Summary:
A massive glyph symbol begins growing in the sky above the jungle basin. The Echobound believe it is a **living memory call**, and want you to commune with it to anchor it to the ground.

## Objectives:
1. Travel to the **Canopy Spire** and scale the treetop shrine.  
2. Collect 3 sky glyph fragments from memory creatures.  
3. Absorb the fragments and perform the ground-anchoring ritual.  
4. Witness the **Skyword Manifestation** (vision + item drop)

## Rewards:
- 700 XP  
- *Echo Bracer* (glows when glyphs shift)  
- New vision chamber unlocked

## Optional Outcome:
- Anchoring the glyph may create a new ambient structure near Stillmere with lore effects
