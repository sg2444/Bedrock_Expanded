**Act:** II  
**Trigger:** After sealing the second shrine in MQ05, player returns to Oldwell to find it deserted.

## Summary
The village has been ransacked. Clues lead to two paths—one through the shattered forges in the mountains, the other to the sealed library in the desert. Player must choose which lead to pursue.

## Objectives
- Investigate ruins in Oldwell
- Recover map fragment from Elder Kaelin’s house
- Choose a path: “Forge” or “Library”

## Outcome
- Unlocks MQ07 or MQ08 depending on player’s choice

## Narrative Threads
- If the player completed SQ5 (Kaelin’s Memory), they receive a prophetic vision hinting which path aligns with their destiny.
