# MQ06: A New Dawn

## Summary

Against all odds, the Ender Dragon has been defeated and the long night has given way to a new dawn. You emerge back into the Overworld as the **hero of the realm**, greeted by rejoicing villagers. With the dragon’s shadow lifted, peace and light return to the land. All that remains is to inform the Village Elder of your success and partake in a well-earned celebration of victory. Though challenges may continue in this world, this chapter of darkness has been closed, thanks to your courage.

## Objectives

1. **Return Home:** Leave the End (step through the exit portal after defeating the dragon) and return to the Overworld.
2. **Back to the Village:** Travel home to the village safely with the proof of the dragon’s defeat.
3. **Speak to the Village Elder:** Inform the Elder of your triumph. _(This completes the main questline and triggers the village’s celebration of your heroism.)_

## Recommended XP

- **Experience Reward:** ~500 XP (a final token of gratitude from the villagers for saving their world)

## Rewards

- **Elytra** – A pair of elytra (wings) gifted to you so you may soar the skies in honor of the dragon you felled.
- **Firework Rocket x32** – Fireworks to power your maiden voyages with the elytra, symbolizing the celebratory spirits of the villagers.
- **Netherite Ingot** – A single rare netherite ingot, a token of the villagers’ gratitude, to upgrade one of your diamond items to the highest tier.

## Quest Giver Dialogue (Village Elder)

- "You’ve returned to us alive... and victorious! **The dragon is defeated**? Truly?! This is a miracle I hardly dared to imagine. You have saved us all!"
- "The sky is brighter this morning than I’ve ever seen. **A new dawn breaks**, thanks to your bravery. The whispers of fear are gone, replaced by songs of your heroism across the village."
- "Please, accept these gifts as a token of our eternal gratitude. These **wings** were crafted from legends (and a bit of wandering trader’s stock). With them, you can soar above our lands as free as a bird. And this ingot... it’s a strange metal we found in the mines, harder than diamond – may it serve you well in your future adventures."
- "We will tell **stories of your deeds** for generations, hero. From now on, know that you will always have a home here, and our people will remember your name under each sunrise of this new era of peace."
