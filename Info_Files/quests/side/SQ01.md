## Quest Giver Dialogue (Village Elder)

- "Our miners spoke of ghastly noises before the attacks began. Now creatures crawl out of that old shaft each night. Please, brave one, **investigate the old mine** and make it safe for us again."
- "Be on your guard down there. The tunnels are narrow and **the darkness hides many terrors**. If you find the source of this evil—or any clue of what’s behind it—bring it back. We must know what we’re facing."
- "Thank the heavens you’ve returned safely! What have you found? ...This strange artifact was buried in the depths of the mine, you say? It **bears ominous markings** I’ve not seen in ages. You’ve done well to secure the mine, but I fear this is only the beginning of our troubles."
