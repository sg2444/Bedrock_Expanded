# FQ01: Burn the Sigil

## Faction: Order of the Fragmented
## Aligned Ending: Seal Path
## Summary:
A nearby glyph shrine has reawakened after the Echo's partial reactivation. The Order has decreed it must be purged before it can fully align. You are sent to oversee a ritual burn and ensure no resistance from nearby glyph cultists.

## Objectives:
1. Travel to the reactivated glyph shrine in the wetlands.
2. Defend the cleansing team during the ritual (3 waves of cultist attackers).
3. Place the cleansing torch and initiate the seal disruption.
4. Decide whether to take a glyph fragment for yourself or destroy it.

## Rewards:
- 500 XP
- Fragmented Cloak (Cosmetic)
- Cleansing Torch (used in future glyph quests)

## Consequences:
- If you take the fragment, Order trust lowers.
- If destroyed, shrine becomes inert and sealed permanently.
