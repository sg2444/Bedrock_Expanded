# SQX05: Memory for Sale

## Type: Social / Moral Choice  
## Region: Stillmere Market  
## Prerequisite: MQ07+ complete, Memory Fragments encountered

---

## Summary
A mysterious peddler arrives in Stillmere claiming to sell **bottled memories**: joy, fear, skill, even fragments of the Collapse. While some villagers are intrigued, others report strange after-effects. You must investigate — and decide whether the trade of memory is freedom… or exploitation.

---

## Objectives
1. Speak to the **Memory Peddler** in the market square.  
2. Try one of the following samples:  
   - *Memory of First Flight*  
   - *Memory of Fire*  
   - *Memory of Falling Stars*  
3. Choose to:  
   - Buy full vials for personal gain  
   - Warn the town  
   - Shut down the stall  
4. Optional: trace the memories’ source via Echo Plane residue

## Rewards
- 550 XP  
- *Echo-Tinged Vial* (consumable: activates random dream memory at rest)  
- Side effect based on choice:  
   - Greater empathy (villager dialogue softens)  
   - Minor corruption risk (glyphs whisper sooner)  
   - Unlocks rare lore vision if traced

## Dialogue

### Memory Peddler
> “Why suffer through life, when you can buy one someone already lived?”  
> “Take it. Taste it. That joy? It was real — once.”

### Villager Reactions
> “I remembered being a warrior in the east. Then I forgot my son’s name.”  
> “It was beautiful… but it didn’t belong to me.”

### Tracing Memory Residue (Dreamwalker Only)
> *(“This one… this memory… was stolen from a dying priest. He never gave it freely.”)*  
> *(“Some things aren’t meant to be shared.”)*

## Notes
- Shutting down the stall earns trust from Kaelin or Seeker  
- Supporting it unlocks black market memory trades in later towns  
- Dreamwalker sees hidden threads between bottled memories and glyph echoes
