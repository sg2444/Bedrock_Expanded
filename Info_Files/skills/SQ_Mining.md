# SQ: Mining Path – Beneath the Glyph

## Skill Path: Mining / Resource Lore  
## Alignment: Neutral (Available post-MQ05 or after encountering Infused Stone)

---

## Overview
This path is available after you collect **Infused Stone** or uncover echo-infused ore deposits. A retired miner named **Hennick** offers to train you in a forgotten discipline: **glyph-vein prospecting**, an ancient craft abandoned after the first Collapse.

---

## Quest 1: *Soundless Depths*

### Summary
Hennick suspects one of the original glyph mines lies beneath the abandoned settlement of Wyrm’s Hollow. He believes echoes still linger in the earth — and they may be listening.

### Objectives
1. Travel to **Wyrm’s Hollow Mines**, sealed and overgrown.  
2. Use a *Seismic Tuner* (given by Hennick) to navigate three unstable mine shafts.  
3. Avoid collapses and evade **Echo Shadows** (blind mobs attracted by sound).  
4. Recover a sample of **Raw Echo Ore** and escape.

### Rewards
- 300 XP  
- *Seismic Tuner* tool  
- Unlocks ore tracking UI or compass  
- Opens next quest

---

## Quest 2: *Beneath the Glyph*

### Summary
Using the ore, Hennick deduces that infused stone pulses differently near old glyph relics. He sends you to a buried monolith fragment to **map resonance waves** and locate deeper material seams.

### Objectives
1. Locate a buried glyph shard cave.  
2. Set up three *Resonance Markers* in key points using Hennick’s gear.  
3. Survive a wave of **Rockbound Guardians** awakened by interference.  
4. Complete the mapping and transmit data to Hennick.

### Rewards
- 500 XP  
- *Glyph Extractor* tool  
- Unlocks infused material node visibility  
- Enables crafting of upgraded tools

---

## Quest 3: *Fragment Whispers*

### Summary
Hennick warns that digging too deep risks awakening **latent memory shards**. He believes some are sentient. You must retrieve one from the lower shaft… without being fully seen.

### Objectives
1. Descend into the **Silent Chasm**, a natural glyph-infused cavern.  
2. Solve a movement puzzle: stay in shadow or avoid glyph-triggered light zones.  
3. Retrieve a **Whispering Fragment** — an ore that speaks when touched.  
4. Escape with the fragment and decide whether to deliver it or listen to it.

### Rewards
- 700 XP  
- *Echo Core Ingot*  
- *Fragment Tuner* (allows communication with certain Echo items)  
- Unlocks memory-sensitive pickaxes and access to secret Echo Plane node

---

## Optional Unlocks
- Echo-aligned pickaxes (with passive memory ping in glyph zones)  
- Dreamwalker synergy (certain fragments now appear during dreams)  
- Echo Cult alt-path: if you deliver 3 Whispers, unlock corrupted mining perks  
- Golem crafting quest (coming from infusing three fragment types)

---

## Notes
- Available to all players but deepens if Echo is *freed* or *balanced*.  
- Certain ores “hum” when carried near shrines — used in later crafting and lore unlocks.  
- Whispers from final fragment may influence MQ epilogue (if dream sequences are re-enabled).
