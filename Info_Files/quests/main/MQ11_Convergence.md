# MQ11: Convergence

## Act: III  
## Theme: Climax, Moral Choice  
## Mechanics: Dialogue, Battle, Branching Path  
## Narrative Purpose: Brings major factions together; player chooses path toward sealing, freeing, or reshaping the Echo

---

## Summary
The truth cannot be ignored. The Echo is not a force of evil — it is memory, potential, raw truth unshaped by time. But truth without wisdom can still destroy. As you approach the Final Shrine, forces converge: the **Fragmented**, the **Echo Cult**, Kaelin, and others. They each have a plan. You must choose one.

Your next act will either **seal** the Echo once more, **free** it entirely, or **reshape** the world to host it safely. But you must choose. The shrine opens only for one path.

---

## Objectives
1. **Reach the Final Shrine at the top of the Hollow Peak**.  
2. **Engage in dialogue with all present factions** at the convergence camp.  
3. **Choose a path:**  
   - Seal the Echo  
   - Free the Echo  
   - Shape the World (balance path)  
4. **Defend your choice** in battle — the opposing factions attack.  
5. **Insert the Memory Key and prepare for activation**.

## Rewards
- **XP:** 1000 XP  
- **Items:**  
  - *Memory Key Fragment (2/2)* → becomes *Final Shrine Keystone*  
  - *Armor of the Ancients* (light, medium, or heavy variant depending on path)  
- **Effect:** Locks in the player’s endgame path; affects MQ12 content, postgame world state, and NPC dialogue globally.

## Dialogue – Kaelin (If Survived)

> “It’s all converging. Just like they said.”  
> “Every echo has a source. And you were it — or are it.”  
> “You can silence it. Or let it speak. But don’t pretend you can control it.”

---

## Dialogue – The Echo Cult (If Chosen)

> *“Let the Echo rise! Let the glyphs speak! Memory will rule again!”*  
> *“He returns! The Sealbreaker! The Voice!”*

---

## Dialogue – The Fragmented (If Opposed)

> *“You unleash death disguised as light.”*  
> *“We sealed you before. We’ll do it again.”*

---

## Dialogue – Player Vision (Just Before Decision)

> *(You walk a corridor of light. To your left, shrines lie sealed — quiet, cold. To your right, the world burns under knowledge unearned. Ahead: a mirror. Yourself.)*  
> *(“You remember now. But what will you do with it?”)*

## Design Hints
- Convergence site: multi-layered shrine plateau with space for factions to camp/take positions.  
- Dialogue triggers: each group presents its argument; players can interrogate them, refuse, or side.  
- Choice can be UI-driven (“choose path”) or through in-game mechanics (place item in matching altar).  
- Combat: once you choose, the losing factions attack. Number and strength scale with path difficulty.  
- Final Shrine Keystone placement locks in MQ12’s version: Sealed End, Unsealed End, or Balanced World.
