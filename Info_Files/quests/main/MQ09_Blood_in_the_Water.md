---

## Summary
The more glyphs you awaken, the more the world bends — and reacts. As you travel to pursue Kaelin’s trail, you’re intercepted by the **Echo Hunters**: elite agents of the Fragmented, who now see you as a world-ending threat.

This is not a random attack. They’ve studied your path. They know your tools. You must survive their ambush and uncover who sent them — and why they knew exactly where you would be.

## Objectives
1. **Leave the Stillmere woods toward the Shrine Pass.**  
2. **Get ambushed** at the river crossing (cutscene or trap-triggered spawn).  
3. **Defeat all Echo Hunter squads** (3 tactical waves with different formations).  
4. **Loot the Hunter Commander’s satchel** for the Seer’s Orders.  
5. **Return to the surface** or seek out the Fragmented Outpost mentioned in the notes.

## Dialogue – Echo Hunters (During Ambush)

> *“Target confirmed. The Sealbreaker has entered the pass.”*  
> *“They should have let you fade, Echoborn.”*  
> *“End the lineage. End the memory.”*

## Seer’s Orders (Found Item)

> “Phase Line Alpha held until Vault disruption. Subject’s glyph pattern now unstable — they resonate on approach.”  
> “Deploy squads to intercept north pass. If subject escapes, initiate Outpost Burn Directive.”  
> “The Final Shrine must remain sealed until Judgment Day. Echo must not return.”

## Design Hints
- Ambush should be sudden and cinematic: fog rolls in, bridge cracks, enemies emerge from cliffs.  
- Use different Echo Hunter types:  
  - Scout (speed-based melee)  
  - Anchor (shielded, tanky)  
  - Whisperer (ranged spell mimic or arrow specialist)  
- Boss-like “Commander” drops named satchel.  
- Optional: Player can now find a **Fragmented Outpost** later and decide to infiltrate or ignore (branching impact on MQ11).
