---

## Summary
You awaken alone surrounded by unfamiliar terrain and the quiet hum of something ancient. A monolith stands nearby. Watching. Waiting. As you draw near, the air thickens and glyphs shimmer across its surface. The world shifts. A presence touches your thoughts — vague, ancient, and expectant.

This is the beginning. You are being watched. Or chosen.

----

## Objectives
1. **Approach the Monolith** near the ruins.
2. **Observe the Glyphs** that awaken when touched.
3. **Receive the Guidebook** (triggered via ScriptEvent or automatic).
4. **Begin First Memories** — a vision or whisper (light cutscene or message).
5. **Seek guidance in the nearby village** (leads into MQ02).

- **XP:** 50 XP (enough for 1–2 basic levels)

  - *Monolith Fragment (Uncharged)* — a mysterious quest item  
- **World Change:** Unlocks new dialogue options in the village

## Dialogue – Elder Kaelin (Initial Encounter)

> “You’ve seen it, haven’t you? The stone called to you. As it once did to me... before I forgot.”

> “Most pass it by, a relic of some forgotten faith. But not you. It woke for you. The glyphs stirred. The air changed.”

> “You feel it, don’t you? A weight. A whisper at the edge of hearing. The world is old, and much of it... sleeping.”

> “Take this. A guide of sorts. It’s broken, but some pages might still echo. Find your footing, and return to me when the wind shifts.”

## Hints for Design
- Place monolith at world spawn with clear visual prominence.
- Upon interaction, use ScriptEvent to show vision or trigger a faint environmental effect (whisper sound, glyph flash, camera shake).
- Guidebook could open a UI with a few unreadable glyphs, hinting that more will be revealed through progression.
- Village can be visible in the distance; players are free to explore before progressing.
