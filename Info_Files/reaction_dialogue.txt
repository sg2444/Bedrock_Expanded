I. Village & Overworld Reactions
A. Stillmere Villagers (Neutral/Default)
Villagers will respond differently after MQ12 and your faction progression:

If you chose Order of the Fragmented:

“They say you silenced the stones. I sleep better now… but it’s so quiet.”

“Did the glyphs really whisper, or was it just in our heads?”

“The monoliths don’t pulse anymore. That’s your doing, right?”

If you chose Echobound:

“Sometimes I dream of your voice. Not yours exactly… but close.”

“You opened the sky, didn’t you? I saw the light bloom over the shrine.”

“We don’t understand what you did, but we feel it.”

If you chose Monolith Keepers:

“Things feel balanced now. Still strange… but less frightening.”

“The glyphs murmur at night, but not like before. Softer.”

“The kid at the well keeps repeating your name in their sleep.”

B. Gerren the Blacksmith (if Blacksmithing Path taken)
Default:

“Infused stone, eh? Didn’t think I’d live to see it worked again.”

Post-Anvil of Ancients:

“Your hammer sings, same as mine once did. Maybe louder.”

“That new alloy… feels like it remembers being a sword already.”

If you completed Dreamwalker path as well:

“You dream weapons before you forge them? That’s cheating.”

C. Kaelin (if alive / vision form)
If Order-aligned:

“You chose silence. I understand. But sometimes, silence roars.”

If Echobound-aligned:

“I feared what you’d become. But perhaps I feared truth more.”

If Keeper-aligned:

“You held the world in your hand… and placed it back gently. Well done.”

II. Echo Plane NPCs / Ghosts
Depending on ending and alignment, Echo Plane spirits react to your presence:

Order:

“Sealbearer. You walk among us, but deny our voice.”

“Even memory fears you now.”

Echobound:

“He returns. The echo’s echo. The voice within the voice.”

“We sang your name. You sang back.”

Keepers:

“You walk the edge. Neither bound nor broken.”

“You didn’t fix us. You didn’t fail us. You witnessed.”



III. Environmental Feedback
Monolith Changes
Order: glow fades to dim blue or extinguishes entirely.
Echobound: pulsates with brighter hues, whisper audio loops.
Keepers: steady ambient hum, with occasional dream flickers nearby.

Dream Events
If Dreamwalker path completed:

Villagers may “echo” one of your choices at night.

Shrines may show your past dialogue or choices faintly.

Passive whispers reference your memory gift or Echo duel.
