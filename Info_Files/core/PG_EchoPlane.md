# PG: Echo Plane

## Unlocked When:
- MQ12 outcome is *Freed* or *Balanced*
- Player possesses the **Final Shrine Keystone** and *Sealer’s Eye*

---

## Summary:
The Echo Plane is a surreal realm of memory and possibility. Floating monoliths, broken shrines, and glimmering starscapes form a shattered reflection of the overworld. Within it, players can confront alternate timelines, recover lost memories, and test their Echo resonance.

---

## Key Zones:
1. **The Memory Nexus** – central hub, houses memory records and trial gates  
2. **Fragment Isles** – floating puzzle arenas themed around past quests  
3. **The Shard Vault** – rare material drops, accessed via Dreamwalker glyphs  
4. **The Hollow Arena** – challenge zone to face your Echo Self (combat trial)

---

## Activities:
- Memory Trials (platforming, logic, stealth)
- Echo Fragment Hunts (used in dream crafting and cosmetic unlocks)
- Lore replay chambers (view key MQ events from alternate POVs)
- Dreamwalker-only subzone (whisper maze puzzle)

---

## Rewards:
- Echo Sigils (currency)
- Echo Crystal (unique crafting)
- Lore Tablets (1 of 7 per trial set)

---

## Unlocking Travel:
Players can travel between Echo Plane and overworld monoliths using:
- **Resonant Scroll** (crafted from infused stone + memory shard)
- **Echo Gateways** (visible only when Dreammark active)

---

## Notes:
- Visual style: void + constellations + floating blackstone, crystal, particles
- Music should be ethereal and non-rhythmic
