# FQ07: Doctrine's End

## Summary:
A schism erupts in the Order. The Inner Circle attempts a **final purge** of all memory-walkers. You must choose whether to lead the doctrinal future, or dismantle it.

## Objectives:
1. Speak with both Grand Vicar and breakaway Justicar.  
2. Decide which doctrine to enforce:  
   - **Total Purity** (glyph silence, zero tolerance)  
   - **Selective Silence** (controlled glyph access)  
   - **Disband** (end Order’s dogma entirely)  
3. Survive the opposing faction’s ambush.  
4. Issue final proclamation at the Shrine of Judgment.

## Rewards:
- 1200 XP

## Final Effect:
- Monoliths either darken permanently, emit limited memory bursts, or reset for global balance.
