# MQ06: Breaking the Sigil

## Act: I  
## Theme: Disruption, Rising Tension  
## Mechanics: World Event, Combat, Choice  
## Narrative Purpose: Introduces active opposition, warns of coming fracture

---

## Summary
The second shrine’s awakening did not go unnoticed. When you return to the village, you find it under attack by a group known only as the **Fragmented** — a cult-like faction devoted to keeping the monoliths silent. They claim the glyphs are a prison, not a path, and by breaking the sigils, they preserve the world from collapse.

You must defend Oldwell, uncover how the attackers knew your timing, and confront the first of many decisions: **Are you restoring something holy... or unlocking something monstrous?**

---

## Objectives
1. **Return to Oldwell**, which is under siege by cultists (spawn event at town gates).  
2. **Repel the Fragmented attackers** (wave-based combat: 2–3 waves, includes melee + ranged variants).  
3. **Find the Marked Cultist** and retrieve their glyph-scored journal.  
4. **Confront Elder Kaelin** about the contents of the journal.  
5. **Choose whether to destroy the third sigil’s location or continue toward it.**

## Rewards
- **XP:** 500 XP  
- **Items:**  
  - *Fragmented Journal* (quest item with disturbing predictions)  
  - *Reinforced Shield* (crafted from broken cult gear)  
  - *Torch of Clarity* – rare consumable that reveals hidden glyphs on walls  
- **Effect:** Unlocked third shrine path; town is now visibly scarred (a building or two damaged); villagers have new dialogue.

## Dialogue – Elder Kaelin (Upon Your Return)

> “The air... it crackles. Do you feel it?”  
> “What was hidden now screams. And someone answered.”  
> “I saw the mark on their robes. The sigil, upside down. That’s not faith. That’s fear.”  
> “You must go on—but the path will no longer be yours alone.”

---

## Dialogue – Cultist (During Attack)

> *“You break the world with every shrine you touch!”*  
> *“The Echo cannot be tamed — it must remain sealed!”*  
> *“You were sealed away for a reason. We know what you are.”*

---

## Dialogue – Fragmented Journal (Readable Item)

> “The second pulse has triggered. Oldwell is aligned. If the third breaks, the Eye will see.”  
> “He walks again. The one who survived the Collapse. The one the glyphs remember.”  
> “Intervene at the forest gate. Delay him until the others arrive.”  
> “He must not awaken the core.”

---

## Dialogue – Kaelin (Post-Journal)

> “I suspected… but I dared not believe.”  
> “You were part of this once. Their writings confirm it. The glyphs call you back because you *belonged* to them. Once.”  
> “But the world changed, and so did you. Perhaps it’s time you remembered why they sealed the shrines in the first place.”

## Design Hints
- **Village Event:** On player return, trigger ambient smoke, red sky, alarm bell sounds. Cultists attack in formation.  
- **Boss Encounter:** Final wave features a robed enemy with higher health and flame-imbued melee weapon.  
- **Journal:** When examined, unlocks a vision line like: “The Eye will see.” (Sets up MQ07+.)  
- **Moral Tone Shift:** This quest is a pivot—dialogue and setting now subtly suggest ambiguity about your role. Is this resurrection or a mistake?
