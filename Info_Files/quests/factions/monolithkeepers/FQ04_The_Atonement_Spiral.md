# FQ04: The Atonement Spiral

## Summary:
A monolith in the tundra has become unstable. The Keepers believe it contains **frozen guilt** — the thoughts of a sealer who regretted their role. You're tasked with entering the spiral to understand, not erase, their suffering.

## Objectives:
1. Travel to the Tundra Spiral and activate its memory loop.  
2. Relive a corrupted memory (timed logic riddle + environmental puzzle).  
3. Defeat the “Warden of Regret.”  
4. Decide whether to speak the Sealer’s truth or silence it.

## Rewards:
- 850 XP  
- *Balanced Sigil Fragment*  
- Memory cutscene unlocked in the Echo Plane

## Narrative Outcome:
- Truth: echoes of the Sealer’s sorrow influence village NPCs  
- Silence: prevents spread of doubt, but closes one Echo node
