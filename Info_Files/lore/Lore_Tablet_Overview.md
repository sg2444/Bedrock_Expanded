# Lore Tablets – The Seven Sealers

## Overview:
Scattered across the overworld, Echo Plane, and shrine zones are **7 ancient lore tablets**. Each was left behind by one of the original **Sealers** — powerful individuals who participated in the Collapse and helped bind the Echo. These tablets carry insight into their motivations, regrets, and warnings.

---

## Gameplay Purpose:
- Collecting all 7 unlocks a secret **Memory Chamber** in the Echo Plane  
- Each tablet gives both lore and passive clues to hidden crafting or decisions  
- Completing the set may allow the player to **name the Echo** — changing UI/ambient text

---

## Tablet Format:
Each tablet consists of:
- **Sealer’s Name**
- **Region Hidden** (clue or biome type)
- **Inscription** (spoken by reading or via UI)
- Optional **puzzle or guardian** before retrieval
