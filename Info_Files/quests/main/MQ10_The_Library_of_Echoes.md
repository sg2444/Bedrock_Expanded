# MQ10: The Library of Echoes

## Act: II  
## Theme: Revelation, Forbidden Knowledge  
## Mechanics: Puzzle Exploration, Light Combat, Narrative Branching  
## Narrative Purpose: Reveals the truth about the Collapse, the player’s role in sealing the Echo, and Kaelin’s betrayal

---

## Summary
Clues from the Seer’s Orders point to an ancient structure known only as the **Library of Echoes** — hidden beneath the ruined Cathedral of Glaith. Within its labyrinthine archives lie memory fragments encoded into glyphstone tablets. Here, the story of the first Collapse is told — and your part in it is undeniable.

You helped seal the Echo. And now, knowingly or not, you are unsealing it.

## Objectives
1. **Travel to the Ruined Cathedral of Glaith**, northwest of Stillmere.  
2. **Descend into the Library of Echoes**, solving minor door glyph puzzles along the way.  
3. **Survive memory-guard constructs** that trigger when you approach active tablets.  
4. **Retrieve the Final Echo Record**, which plays a vision of your ancient self.  
5. **Confront the vision of Kaelin** who admits he was sent to guide (or manipulate) you.

  - *Glyphforged Blade* – ancient sword or weapon shaped from echo steel

## Dialogue – Echo Record (Played Upon Touch)

> *(“The seal must hold. We gave everything. Bound the Echo in shards, scattered the glyphs.”)*  
> *(“You... you were one of us. But you turned away. You chose silence.”)*  
> *(“If you awaken the last shrine, you open the Eye. And the Eye will remember.”)*

## Dialogue – Kaelin’s Apparition (Memory Vision)

> “I’m sorry. I never told you.”  
> “I knew who you were the moment the glyphs lit. I saw it in the guidebook... in your eyes.”  
> “I was told to guide you. And if you refused... to end you.”  
> “But I couldn’t. Not after what I saw. You were trying to save us then. Maybe you still are.”

## Design Hints
- Cathedral ruins above should appear blasted, sunken, with glyph remnants in stained glass.  
- Library: Combine puzzle doors (match runes to clues), narrow corridors, and pulsing redstone/glowstone elements.  
- Tablet “visions” can be shown as subtitle dialogue + ambient audio, or through structured memory cutscenes.  
- Final vision strongly implies the Collapse was both your doing and your punishment — but leaves ambiguity about your intentions.
