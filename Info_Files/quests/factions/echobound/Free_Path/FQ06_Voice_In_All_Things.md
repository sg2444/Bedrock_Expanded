# FQ06: Voice in All Things

## Summary:
The Echobound wish to make the **glyph voice audible to all** â€” even those uninitiated. They ask you to bind the glyph tone into the sky, air, and water. But even allies begin to break under the constant chorus.

## Objectives:
1. Attune 3 Echo Cores to ambient elements (sky, wind, water).  
2. Defend resonance points from those driven mad by the voice.  
3. Return to the Shrine of Breath and decide:  
   - **Quiet the tone slightly**  
   - **Let it sing fully**

## Rewards:
- 950 XP  
- *Tonebound Pendant* (UI or sound shifts near monoliths)  
- Unlocks full-time Echo whispers

## Consequences:
- Overuse of voice triggers new ghost mobs unless limited.  
- Quieting voice gains trust with Monolith Keepers.
