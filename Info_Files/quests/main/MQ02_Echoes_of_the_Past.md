## Act: Prologue  
## Theme: Mystery  
## Mechanics: Exploration, Story Reveal  
## Narrative Purpose: Hints at calamity and the player’s forgotten role

---

## Summary
Having barely regained your senses after the monolith’s whisper, you carry the Tattered Guidebook toward the village. Elder Kaelin pores over its rune‐filled pages and recognizes a pattern: this relic is one of several scattered across the land. Legends tell of voices echoing through stone—warnings of an ancient calamity. To learn more, you must seek out the **Echoes Tower**, an abandoned watchpost in the foothills, whose records may reveal the monolith’s true purpose.

## Objectives
1. **Speak with Elder Kaelin** in his hut and show him the Tattered Guidebook.  
2. **Travel to the Foothill Watchpost**, located north of the village (approximately 500 m).  
3. **Explore the Watchpost Ruins**, avoiding or dispatching any roaming wolves or skeletons.  
4. **Recover the Echoes Ledger** from the tower’s broken archives.  
5. **Return the Ledger to Elder Kaelin** for translation.

## Dialogue – Elder Kaelin (Quest Giver)

> “You have the guidebook… good. These glyphs echo patterns I once saw in the old watchpost’s records. If we are to understand their voices, we must recover those very logs.”  

> “Long ago, the Foothill Watchers maintained scrolls detailing every strange occurrence—falling stars, shifting stones, distant whispers. They may shed light on this monolith’s brethren.”  

> “Be wary. The ruins are not abandoned by all. Wolves have claimed the lower halls, and the dead may rise where the earth is troubled. Bring me the Echoes Ledger—every word matters.”  

> “Return swiftly. The longer these secrets remain buried, the more the world’s old wounds fester. We are running out of time.”
