# MQ05: Forgotten Sanctum

## Act: I  
## Theme: Trial, Memory Recovery  
## Mechanics: Exploration, Environmental Puzzle, Boss Encounter  
## Narrative Purpose: Establishes second shrine, hints at player’s past involvement in the Echo collapse

---

## Summary
The visions from the monolith left a mark—both on the world and on you. Kaelin has identified the **second shrine**, sealed within a mountain cave once known as the **Sanctum of Stillrock**. Long abandoned, the Sanctum contains a puzzle more intricate than the first, and a guardian unlike any you've faced.

You must prove your will against memory, solve the ancient mechanism, and recover the second **Shrine Sigil Fragment**. But something else stirs in the stone—an echo of yourself.

---

## Objectives
1. **Reach the Sanctum of Stillrock**, high in the northern mountain cliffs.  
2. **Unlock the Shrine Doors** using an environmental puzzle (e.g. rotate stone mirrors to align glyph light).  
3. **Defeat the Reflection**, a shadow version of the player wielding one of your abilities.  
4. **Claim the Shrine Sigil Fragment (2/4)** and a piece of your lost memory.  
5. **Return to Kaelin or meditate again** to process the recovered memory.

## Dialogue – Elder Kaelin (Before Departure)

> “The shrine lies within the Stillrock heights. They called it a sanctum once—a word for a place that remembers. Or one that refuses to forget.”  

> “Legends say its seal was keyed not to strength, but to reflection. You will face something more dangerous than a guardian, I fear.”  

> “Whatever lives inside that place, it is tied to you. Be wary. Some truths break more than they heal.”  

---

## Dialogue – The Reflection (Boss Encounter)

> *“Ah... so this is what I’ve become.”*  
> *“You were supposed to forget. We were all supposed to forget.”*  
> *“Let’s see if you’re strong enough... to face yourself.”*  
> *“You can’t kill me. I’m every choice you’ve made. Every name you forgot.”*  

---

## Dialogue – Memory Echo (Post-Fight)

> *(You stand in a mirrored hall, younger, cloaked. You place a glowing core into a monolith. It screams. The sky burns. You turn away.)*  
> *(You were there. You helped seal the Echo. You helped *cause* the collapse.)*  

---

## Dialogue – Elder Kaelin (After Return)

> “You’ve seen more than I have, haven’t you?”  
> “The glyphs hum now when you walk by. You’re resonating with them. As if they remember your name.”  
> “With two shrines awakened, the weave begins to restore. But it also frays at the edges. I fear something else is awakening with it…”

## Design Hints
- **Sanctum Environment:** Mix of icy stone and overgrown ruin. Add reflective surfaces or mirror blocks in puzzle area.  
- **Puzzle:** Light beams need to be reflected off angled mirrors to match glyph marks on the wall. Solution creates a glowing circle that opens the inner gate.  
- **Boss Fight:** Spawn custom “Reflection” mob with nameplate, echo voice, and behaviors mimicking player combat style.  
- **Vision Scene:** ScriptEvent cutscene showing a glimpse of player’s past life — can be minimalist (particles + voice) or visual flashback if possible.  
- Enable occasional “memory whispers” from now on — messages that play when sleeping or approaching certain monoliths.
