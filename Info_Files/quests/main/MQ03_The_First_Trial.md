# MQ03: The First Trial

## Act: I  
## Theme: Challenge, Ancient Forces  
## Mechanics: Puzzle, Combat, Vision Event  
## Narrative Purpose: Establishes monolith network and the first sealed shrine

---

## Summary
With the Echoes Ledger translated, Elder Kaelin has identified the location of the **First Shrine** — a structure buried beneath the old Glimmerroot Caverns. Long ago, the Ancients sealed a fragment of their power within this place. To prove yourself, you must face its trials: solve its puzzle, confront its guardian, and activate the shrine’s core.

You are not just an observer now — you are part of what is returning.

---

## Objectives
1. **Receive the shrine coordinates** from Kaelin after he deciphers the ledger.  
2. **Travel to Glimmerroot Caverns**, a lush, overgrown cave system near the base of the northern cliffs.  
3. **Solve the Glyph Puzzle** to unlock the inner sanctum (3 runes must match pattern found in Ledger).  
4. **Defeat the Shrine Guardian**, a spectral construct of stone and light.  
5. **Activate the Shrine Core** and receive your first **memory vision**.

## Dialogue – Elder Kaelin (Before Departure)

> “This place you seek—Glimmerroot—once fed the roots of the world. The Ancients sealed more than water in its halls. They sealed knowledge... and judgment.”  

> “Only those who can align the glyphs may pass. The ledger speaks of three sigils, each tied to an elemental phrase. Study them well—guessing wrong will summon defenders before their time.”  

> “You must go alone. The stone won’t answer to many feet. But should you return with the sigil, we’ll know the shrines still remember. And if they do... so will the enemy.”

---

## Dialogue – Shrine Guardian (During Combat)

> *“Who walks the path unproven?”*  
> *“Your spirit is dust. Your blood forgotten. Begone.”*  
> *“...The glyph burns true? Then perhaps... perhaps the flame still lives.”*  

---

## Dialogue – Memory Vision (Post-Activation)

> *(You see the sky from above, the world blanketed in green. Three towers channel light. One breaks. Echoes scream. A name — yours? — is whispered and then lost.)*  

> *(The monolith breathes. A pulse spreads through the stone. You are not alone.)*

## Design Hints
- **Glimmerroot Caverns** should feel wild and sacred — filled with glowing flora, mossy blocks, and ambient sounds.  
- **Puzzle Room:** Use glowing glyph blocks that rotate when stepped on; players must match symbols from the Echoes Ledger or Guidebook.  
- **Guardian Fight:** Medium-tier boss (custom mob or armored husk) with two phases: melee then spectral charge attacks.  
- **Vision:** After activating the core, pause time and show cutscene or audio-visual overlay to deliver the “memory.”  
- Activating this shrine **enables optional monolith beacons** throughout the world, which may glow/react when approached later.
