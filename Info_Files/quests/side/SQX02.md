## Dialogue

### Torven
> “She followed the echoes. Said she *heard* the ore singing. She wasn’t wrong.”  
> “I never sealed the place. That’s my curse. That’s my hope.”

### Maera’s Echo (if Dreamwalker)
> *(“It’s warm here. The stone hums. I think I understand now. Don’t come looking… unless you bring music.”)*

### Torven (If you lie)
> “That’s... good. That’s enough. Thank you.” *(He smiles, but it doesn’t reach his eyes.)*

### Torven (If you tell the truth)
> “I knew it. She was meant for more than I could teach. You brought her back. Even this... shard of her.”

## Notes
- Telling the truth enables Torven to become a mentor in Echo Plane forge.  
- Lying gives XP early, but closes off postgame dialogue.
