# FQ06: Blackglass Doctrine

## Summary:
You’re summoned to the Order’s hidden observatory. They’ve discovered a way to reflect Echo resonance using **blackglass prisms**, creating a shield that could permanently block glyph awakening. But it comes at a cost: it must cover the sky.

## Objectives:
1. Retrieve three **Obsidian Hearts** from corrupted shrines.  
2. Activate the Blackglass Array atop Mount Kyrin.  
3. Witness a projected Echo collapse.  
4. Choose to support full sky-veil, or demand moderation.

## Rewards:
- 950 XP  
- *Blackglass Shard* (craftable reflection tool)  
- Echo Plane weakening effect enabled

## Outcome:
- Full shield dampens Echo Plane access, makes world quiet but sterile.  
- Moderate path splits Order loyalty but preserves some Echo flow.
