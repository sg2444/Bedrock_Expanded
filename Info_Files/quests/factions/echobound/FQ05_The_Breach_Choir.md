# FQ05: The Breach Choir

## Summary:
The Echobound are preparing a ritual to **sing** a memory breach into existence â€” an event that lets Echo voices spill into the overworld. You are invited to lead or block it.

## Objectives:
1. Collect 4 harmonics from glyph-attuned NPCs.  
2. Perform or interrupt the ritual at the **Chorus Hollow**.  
3. Defend or disperse the cultists as needed.  
4. Witness what escapes the breach.

## Rewards:
- 900 XP  
- *Glyph-etched Necklace* (boosts resonance-based speech events)  
- Unlocks ambient NPCs who whisper dreamlines

## Branch Effects:
- Leading the ritual brings echo ghosts into overworld (purely aesthetic unless resisted).  
- Interrupting keeps overworld stable but splits the Echobound's loyalty.
