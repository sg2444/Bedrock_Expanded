# PG: Ruined World Variant

## Triggered When:
- MQ12 ends with **Freed Echo** and player chose no stabilization options
- (Optional override via corruption scroll use)

---

## World Effects:
- Randomized **Corruption Storms** (visual + gameplay effects)
- **Cult-occupied Villages** (hostile NPCs replace villagers)
- Monoliths pulse erratically; shrine zones become dangerous
- Passive memory aura damages unprotected players

---

## Gameplay Changes:
- Glyph-imbued mobs spawn during corruption surges
- Shrines occasionally “leak” and spawn memory fragments
- Blacksmiths + traders may flee or offer cursed variants

---

## New Side Quests:
- *Ashes of Oldwell*: Rescue villagers from cult stronghold  
- *Burning Words*: Use infused scroll to temporarily calm a monolith  
- *Whispers Too Loud*: Seek out corrupted Dreamwalker whose visions break time

---

## Optional Endings:
- If player rebonds 3 corrupted shrines, they can stabilize the world  
- If they abandon it, the world becomes a permanent Echo wilderness
