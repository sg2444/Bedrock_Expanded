# MQ04: Voice in the Stone

## Act: I  
## Theme: Revelation, Unease  
## Mechanics: Dialogue, Light Exploration, Lore Unlock  
## Narrative Purpose: Connects player to monolith network, introduces the Echo Spirit

---

## Summary
After awakening the First Shrine, strange phenomena begin occurring across the land. Kaelin grows anxious—he hears things when near the monoliths, and the sky seems wrong at dusk. He asks you to return to the central monolith and meditate. There, you will experience your first **direct communion** with the voice behind the glyphs.

The voice is not entirely hostile… but it knows you. It calls you by name.

---

## Objectives
1. **Return to the central Monolith** at the village outskirts.  
2. **Meditate beneath the glyphs** (use `/scriptevent` or a bed UI prompt at night).  
3. **Experience the Echo Vision** — a semi-cutscene or UI-based dialogue sequence.  
4. **Return to Kaelin** with what you heard.  
5. **Optionally visit a secondary monolith** (unlocks a new network node).

## Rewards
- **XP:** 250 XP  
- **Items:**  
  - *Glyph-Etched Pendant* (wearable cosmetic or trinket with lore description)  
  - *Scroll of Binding Words* – fragment of ancient language (used in later quests)  
- **Effect:** Monoliths around the world now occasionally whisper when near; player has entered a semi-connected state with the Echo

## Dialogue – Elder Kaelin (Before Meditation)

> “The glyphs shimmer now, even at dawn. I saw one ripple as I passed... and heard it whisper your name. That has never happened before.”  

> “I believe the shrine awoke something. And it is... looking at you.”  

> “Go to the stone. Let it speak. You are part of this, more than you know. Perhaps it will explain why.”  

---

## Dialogue – The Echo (During Vision)

> *“Child of clay. You return. The seal is broken... but the core remains.”*  

> *“We knew you. When the stars fell. When the stone bled. You were there.”*  

> *“We remember your shape... but not your shadow. Where have you gone?”*  

> *“More shrines must awaken. More truth must bleed. When you are ready... we will show you what you were.”*

## Dialogue – Elder Kaelin (After)

> “A voice? It spoke to you?”  

> “...Then the legends were true. The monoliths are not memory—they are intelligence. Collective. Waiting for a signal. And I fear it was you.”  

> “We must act quickly. The glyphs are aligning. I need you to visit the second shrine, hidden deep in the mountain. I will mark the way. Go prepared.”

## Design Hints
- Meditating at the monolith should use either:
  - A bed UI trigger (night-only, prompts a “commune” dialogue)
  - A dedicated scriptevent trigger if glyph proximity is sensed  
- Vision sequence could be:
  - A dim UI scene with slow text crawl
  - Faint glyphs appearing in particles or overlay
  - Ambient music shifts with whispered voice lines  
- After this quest, passive whisper audio or UI glyph flicker occurs near active monoliths, reinforcing the player’s “connection” to them.
