# FQ02: Guide the Memorywalker

## Summary:
A young villager begins dreaming of the glyphs unprompted. The Keepers believe they are a **natural memorywalker** and task you with protecting them during a sacred dream rite.

## Objectives:
1. Escort the dreamer to a shrine chamber.  
2. Fend off Echo cultists attempting to intervene.  
3. Listen to the dreamer’s vision and mark the sequence.  
4. Choose whether to teach or bind the dreamer’s gift.

## Rewards:
- 600 XP  
- *Harmonic Thread* (used in crafting neutral items)  
- Villager may join shrine network as NPC

## Consequences:
- Binding keeps the gift safe, but suppresses potential postgame guidance  
- Teaching unlocks new dynamic dreams, with risk of corruption
