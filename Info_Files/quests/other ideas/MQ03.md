# MQ03: Into the Nether

## Summary

Having deciphered the old tome, the village scholar reveals a plan to combat the looming evil. To stand a chance against the Dragon of legend, you must create the means to find it – the Eyes of Ender. For this, **blaze rods** imbued with otherworldly fire are required, obtainable only in the hellish Nether. The scholar directs you to an abandoned portal and urges you to brave the flaming abyss. Venture into the Nether, secure the blaze rods, and return alive with the fiery essence needed for the next step of your quest.

## Objectives

1. **Prepare a Nether Portal:** Locate the ruined obsidian portal on the outskirts of the swamp (or construct a portal if you have the materials) and **light the Nether Portal**.
2. **Enter the Nether:** Step through into the Nether, a perilous realm of fire and brimstone.
3. **Find a Fortress:** Navigate the crimson landscapes and locate a **Nether Fortress**, the stronghold of dangerous Nether mobs.
4. **Collect Blaze Rods:** Confront the deadly Blazes in the fortress and obtain their blaze rods (0/5 Blaze Rods collected).
5. **Return to the Overworld:** Escape the Nether with the blaze rods and **bring them to the Scholar** back in the village.

## Recommended XP

- **Experience Reward:** ~500 XP (for overcoming the extreme dangers of the Nether)

## Rewards

- **Diamond Sword** – A finely crafted diamond blade, significantly boosting your combat power.
- **Potion of Healing (Instant Health II) x2** – Brewed by the scholar as thanks; these potions will help you recover in dire moments.
- **Golden Apple** – A rare enchanted treat to fortify you in upcoming battles.

## Quest Giver Dialogue (Village Scholar)

- "The tome’s prophecy is clear: to find and face this Dragon, we must first craft **Eyes of Ender**. For that, we need the fiery cores of **Blaze rods**, found only in the Nether. There’s an abandoned portal frame in the swamp nearby; with a few obsidian blocks, you should be able to **repair and ignite it**."
- "The Nether… a realm of constant dusk and burning heat. **Seek out a Nether Fortress** once you step through. Within its basalt halls dwell Blazes – burning spirits that guard the flame. You’ll need to **wrest their rods** from them. Steel yourself; the air itself will try to kill you in that place."
- "You’ve made it back alive! I can’t believe my eyes. These Blaze rods crackle with arcane fire… just what we need. With this blaze powder, we can fashion the Eyes of Ender. Rest now if you must, but know that **our true challenge lies ahead**. You’ve done excellently to survive the Nether’s fury."
