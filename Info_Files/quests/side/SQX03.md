# SQX03: Last Light of Glinthaven

## Type: Rescue / Survival  
## Region: Glinthaven (Ruined Village)  
## Prerequisite: MQ06 complete (Fragmented have attacked)

---

## Summary
A Fragmented scout reports that **Glinthaven**, once a thriving outpost, is now collapsing into a glyphstorm vortex. Faint signals indicate there are still survivors. You must reach the town before the storm fully seals the area — and decide who can be saved.

---

## Objectives
1. Travel to Glinthaven within 1 in-game day of hearing the call.  
2. Search for 3 groups of survivors:  
   - The wounded in the chapel  
   - A family in the underground cistern  
   - An old glyph scholar trapped in the library  
3. Choose which two of the three to escort back — time does not allow all.  
4. Evacuate before the glyphstorm overtakes the central plaza.  
5. Return to the Stillmere outskirts and report what was saved.

## Rewards
- 600 XP  
- *Storm-Shield Charm* (resistance to minor glyph pulses)  
- Reputation with rescued survivors (unlocks future events)

## Dialogue

### Glyphstorm Announcer (Echo Voice)
> *(“Collapse... begins with choice.”)*  
> *(“Three lights. You carry two. Which shall fade?”)*

### Wounded Chapel Survivor
> “You’re here. Gods, I didn’t think anyone would come. Just... help the others first. Please.”

### Glyph Scholar
> “I can walk. Barely. But I have the codex. If I fall, take it. Or all this was for nothing.”

### Survivor Reaction Post-Evacuation
> “You chose... and someone lived. That has to mean something.”

## Notes
- The family gives you passive Echo resistance dialogue later.  
- Saving the scholar enables translation of one lost glyph in postgame.  
- Saving chapel survivors strengthens civilian presence near monoliths.
