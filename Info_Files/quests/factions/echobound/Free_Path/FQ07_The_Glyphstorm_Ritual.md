# FQ07: The Glyphstorm Ritual

## Summary:
The Echobound prepare to **summon a global glyphstorm** â€” a memory cascade that binds past and future. You must decide whether to complete it, hijack it, or disperse it forever.

## Objectives:
1. Anchor glyph nodes in 5 biome locations.  
2. Channel a glyphstorm using the *Heart of Resonance*.  
3. Survive the vision collapse trial (time loop + choice memory).  
4. Final Decision:
   - **Trigger Glyphstorm** (flood world with memory)  
   - **Bind It** (limit glyphs to chosen locations)  
   - **Disperse** (let memory fade)

## Rewards:
- 1300 XP  
- *Heart of Resonance* (quest token + crafting base)  
- Echo Plane reshapes based on choice (lush, crystalline, or cracked)

## Final Result:
- Memory vision events become global, regional, or dormant.
