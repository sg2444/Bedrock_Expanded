# FQ04: Embers of Control

## Summary:
A rogue sub-faction of the Order believes even you have been corrupted by prolonged exposure to the glyphs. They attempt to wrest control by issuing a **doctrinal override** on your authority. You must confront them â€” or agree to undergo a purity trial.

## Objectives:
1. Meet with the **Inner Circle** emissary in the Highwatch Ruins.  
2. Choose to:  
   - Accept the Purity Trial (puzzle + dialogue test)  
   - Reject it and defeat the Inquisitor  
3. Recover the **Purity Seal** and decide to keep or destroy it.

## Rewards:
- 700 XP  
- *Order Signet Band* (cosmetic + loyalty-based flavor text)  
- Side reward based on purity outcome

## Branch Impact:
- Keeping the seal solidifies your position; rejecting opens secret alliances (with Keepers or Watchers)
